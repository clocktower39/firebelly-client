            There are online programs for anyone that wants just their program written for them, but
            doesnâ€™t want any coaching.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Programs for those that want the convenience of an online program, but also want it more
            customized; or may need help through some in-person or virtual coaching sessions.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            And of course, programs that are very customized with frequent communication!
          </Typography>

          <Typography>Some program examples include:</Typography>
          <List sx={{ listStyleType: "disc", pl: 4 }}>
            <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item" }}>Calisthenics</ListItem>
            <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item" }}>Fat Loss</ListItem>
            <ListItem sx={{ display: "list-item" }}>Flexibility & Mobility</ListItem>
